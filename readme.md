1. Erase commits and reorder so its tagged progression.
2. Complete all un-opionated blanks....
    - this is always a problem with starter kits, peopel work on them too much so they become too coupled, and hard to understand... 
3. Minimise files.... but keep nice blank structure.. 
4. indicate what needs "completing" to make it work..
