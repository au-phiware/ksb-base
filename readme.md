- ye olde deps

todo

- make it work again but not very much 

0.1 intentially blank currently.. but has a structure.
0.2 Update deps and code to work...
1. Erase commits and reorder so its tagged progression.
2. Complete all un-opionated blanks....
    - this is always a problem with starter kits - already will fill in some helpful parts and have it renamed as a koa-stable and have two variants api/www that are based on less opinionated bluesky, and completed structure. 
3. Minimise files.... but keep nice blank structure.. 
4. indicate what needs "completing" to make it work..
