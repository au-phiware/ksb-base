# simple blank with shrink-wrapped minimal deps
## Ignore for now as dirty committing. but you can easily make it work.. if you just correct missing files, and put in middleware config, then just load controllers, and anything else... 
desc
- eventual starter.. slightly opinionated and for mongo.. Using only stable simple Middleware.
- intentionally blank currently.. but has a structure.
- sub apps make flow control and lifecycle too complicated in my experience.
- only include having lots of routes to make apis(s) if it was not a microservice.
future
- any functional service style helpers.
- not a blank anymore.. need to have this cloned as part of another repo.
why
- intend to use koa where posssible with Node, for apis, ms, and anything else; as I really like it.
