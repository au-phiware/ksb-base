# simple blank with shrink-wrapped minimal deps
# will setup base to be extended.

currently quite empty, as I will extend this with flavouring and also generalise quite a lot of boring stupid stuff that 
sometimes is needed... but in a way that is as encapsulated.. at least this is my current thinking.. I need to pause and 
consider the galaxy and universe solutions...

And also a simple extension of just micro modules.
