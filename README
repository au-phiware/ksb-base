# simple blank with shrink-wrapped minimal deps
## Ignore for now as dirty committing. but you can easily make it work.. if you just correct missing files, 
and put in middleware config, then just load controllers, and anything else... 
- each mw config will be sep to org instance anyhow... for security etc or project dep.
- intend to use Koa where posssible with Node, for apis, ms, and anything else; as I really like it.
