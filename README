# simple blank with shrink-wrapped minimal deps
desc
- eventual starter.. slightly opinionated and for mongo.. Using only stable simple Middleware.
- intentionally blank currently.. but has a structure.
- sub apps make flow control and lifecycle too complicated in my experience.
- only include having lots of routes to make apis(s) if it was not a microservice.
future
- any functional service style helpers.
- not a blank anymore.. need to have this cloned as part of another repo.
why
- intend to use koa where posssible with Node, for apis, ms, and anything else; as I really like it.
