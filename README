# simple blank with shrink-wrapped minimal deps
# will setup base to be extended.
- currently quite empty, as mw config should be automatic, 
- only stable middleware choices
- only simple middleware 
- limited deps
- provide mechanisms to do a lot of _stuff_ that typically has to happen in the modern world... 
- allow flavouring for future service types

- this actually is quite a nice blank starting point - i think the complex version that uses a config should be another repo
