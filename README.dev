# simple blank with shrink-wrapped minimal deps
done
- ye olde deps
todo
- I think im slightly out of date still... need to catchup
- make it work again but not very much. have mw configured in a nice generalised mechanism so its easily extensible as thats the 
ground work needed usually and can become messy... maybe a dot path config of sets, for each category, or just dot path big list
- Erase commits and reorder so its tagged progression.
- try to leave as agnostic as possible.
- Minimise files.... but keep nice blank structure.
- indicate what needs "completing" to make it work.
- MW choices, sub apps, route - just for one use case.
problems
- dont write a framework at all costs...
wont
- use adventure or curses style fun menus or just a prompt.
- no db - too many of them - all need config and debug, library - dao - 
-- making it mongo or anything else and then a tree of mw, or config... hmmm...  //     "koa-mongo": "^1.1.0", /koa-falcor
