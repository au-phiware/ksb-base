# simple blank with shrink-wrapped minimal deps
done
- ye olde deps
todo
- I think im slightly out of date still... need to catchup
- make it work again but not very much. have mw configured in a nice generalised mechanism so its easily extensible as
thats the ground work needed usually and can become messy... maybe a dot path config of sets, for each category, or
just dot path big list
- Erase commits and reorder so its tagged progression.
- try to leave as agnostic as possible.
- Minimise files.... but keep nice blank structure.
- indicate what needs "completing" to make it work.
- MW choices, sub apps, route - just for one use case.
problems
- dont write a framework at all costs...
wont
- use adventure or curses style fun menus or just a prompt.
- no db - too many of them - all need config and debug, library - dao -
-- making it mongo or anything else and then a tree of mw, or config... hmmm...  //     , /koa-falcor
desc
- eventual starter.. slightly opinionated and for mongo.. Using only stable simple Middleware.
- intentionally blank currently.. but has a structure.
- sub apps make flow control and lifecycle too complicated in my experience.
- only include having lots of routes to make apis(s) if it was not a microservice.
future
- any functional service style helpers.
- not a blank anymore.. need to have this cloned as part of another repo.
why
- must be as non evolved but grounded as possible.. although have evolved flavours...
- almost any problem was easy to solve. and the es7 approach makes life very easy.
